# Artificial Intelligence Weekly Assignment

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for my weekly assignment in the Artificial Intelligence course. The assignment focuses on implementing and visualizing the Uniform Cost Search (UCS) algorithm on a predefined graph. The goal is to find the optimal path cost between two locations within the given graph.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `ucs_visualization.py`: The main Python script that implements the UCS algorithm, graph creation, and visualization of the UCS tree.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3
- Required Python packages (install using `pip`):
  - networkx
  - pydot
  - Pillow (PIL fork)
